# 🎙️ Hugging Face Speech-to-Text using Transformers

This project demonstrates how to convert speech audio into text using the `transformers` library by Hugging Face, specifically leveraging pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Utilizes Hugging Face's powerful `transformers` models for speech-to-text.
- 🎧 Reads and processes `.wav` audio files.
- 🛠 Converts audio into transcribed text using `Wav2Vec2`, a pretrained ASR model.
- 💬 Prints the transcription for easy readability.
- ⚡ Quick to set up and test on your own audio samples.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hugging_face_Speech_to_Text.git
cd Hugging_face_Speech_to_Text
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch transformers librosa soundfile
3. Run the Notebook
You can open and run the notebook using Jupyter or VS Code:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Hugging_face_Speech_to_Text.ipynb
📋 How It Works
Load Audio: The notebook reads a .wav audio file.

Preprocessing: Uses librosa to ensure audio is sampled at 16kHz.

Model Loading: Loads a pretrained facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h model and processor.

Transcription: The audio input is passed through the ASR pipeline.

Output: Transcribed text is printed.

📷 Example Output
Input: sample.wav (an audio file saying "Hello, how are you?")
Output:

text
Copy
Edit
hello how are you
💡 Use Cases
